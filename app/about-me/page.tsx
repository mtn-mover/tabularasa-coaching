                I was trained at Coaching for Transformation, a coaching school accredited by the International Coaching Federation. I hold certificates in Executive Career Coaching, Organizational Coaching, Transformational Coaching, and Spirituality Based Coaching.

In addition I recently acquired a certificate for Executive Presence and Influence from Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Tabula Rasa Coaching offers coach training, education, and peer support to active coaches and coaches wishing to build their practices and broaden their skills and tools through classes, workshops, and one-on-one mentoring.

              <p>
                I am also an accredited recovery-to-wellness coach, working with people struggling with chronic illness and addictions. I served as SVP and global head of marketing for Foundation for Recovery to Wellness, a coaching school based in London for 2 years.

                As an International Executive Transformational Coach, I work with every level of the organizational chart in companies around the world â€“ coaching, mentoring, and consulting.

              <p>
                With a background of over 20 years in luxury interior design sales to the trade, I reinvented myself to follow my passion of helping others see what is possible in their lives. While working full time, I returned to school in New York City to become a Certified Professional Coach. After graduation I continued to expand my coaching tool kit by adding career coaching, organizational coaching and spirituality coaching to my practice. Within my first year of practice, I took my practice international with clients in the UK, Russia, France, Turkey, Canada, and Italy. Today I work with clients all over the globe, including the Middle East.

                I am a long-time student of neuroscience and behavioral psychology. I earned a certificate from Queensland University, Australia, in the Science of Everyday Thinking. Understanding how the brain works is influential in removing many blocks and obstacles for clients and teams as they move forward.
